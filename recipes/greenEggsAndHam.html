        <h2>Green Eggs and Ham <em>served sunny side up</em></h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired from the Dr. Seuss story, 
                    <em>of the same name,</em> this dish is a hearty breakfast 
                    made silly with the shades of green. Don't be fooled, 
                    we aren't preparing food well past its expiration, it'll be fresh
                    as ever. 
                </p>
