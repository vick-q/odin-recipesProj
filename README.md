# odin-recipesProj
A page of recipes linking back to a home page. 
    I started this project with little confidence, i felt so lost still
    and it disheartened me because this was the "easy part." But after going through the project I was surprised with how much I actually remembered. I had my notes that I was jotting down as I went through the html and git part of the course
    and they helped tremendously. I made use of the headers and different "h" tags.
    As well as the lists, unordered and ordered. I even felt confident in using some of the other material I was taught, such as the "strong" tag and "em" tag to add to my recipes. 
    For my recipes I kept the steps and descriptions simple. I do not expect anyone to actually try and make these dishes. It was mainly for me to easily accomplish the project requirements and get familiar with the code. It felt good to be able to get my first bits of code in without any hand holding. I am hopeful in what comes next and to continue to learn more.
